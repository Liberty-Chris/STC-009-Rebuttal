# Adoption Metrics: Evaluating Blockchain Usage and Growth

## **Overview**
This discussion focuses on assessing the validity of various adoption metrics used to evaluate blockchain ecosystems. The goal is to determine which metrics provide the most accurate representation of actual adoption and usage for selecting the most suitable blockchain for the Wyoming Stable Token.

## **Key Questions**
- Are **Daily Active Addresses (DAA)** a reliable indicator of blockchain adoption, or can they be manipulated?
- Should transaction **value and distribution** be considered more heavily than raw activity numbers?
- What are the best **indicators of long-term adoption** and actual network utility?
- How do **staking participation rates** reflect user commitment to a network?
- Which blockchains exhibit **real, organic growth** vs. artificial inflation from Sybil attacks or wash trading?

## **Assessing Adoption Metrics**
Please contribute insights on how different blockchains measure and report adoption:

### **Commonly Used Metrics**
- [ ] **Daily Active Addresses (DAA):** Number of unique addresses transacting daily
- [ ] **Total Transaction Volume:** Total value transferred on-chain over a given period
- [ ] **Staking Participation:** Percentage of total supply actively staked
- [ ] **Gas Fees and Network Congestion:** Indicators of real demand for block space
- [ ] **Unique Wallet Growth Over Time:** Measures network expansion
- [ ] **Decentralized Application (dApp) Usage:** Number of smart contracts and interactions

## **Blockchain-Specific Adoption Data**
### **Ethereum**
- [ ] High DAA but significant **bot-driven transactions**
- [ ] Leading in **smart contract deployment and dApp adoption**

### **Solana**
- [ ] High transaction throughput but **potential for spam transactions**
- [ ] Network congestion during high activity periods

### **Cardano**
- [ ] Strong staking participation with a **highly decentralized pool ecosystem**
- [ ] Gradual adoption of **smart contracts and dApps**

### **Avalanche, Sui, and Stellar**
- [ ] Adoption trends and active ecosystem analysis needed
- [ ] Indicators of organic growth vs. artificial transaction inflation

## **Community Input**
Please share:
- Case studies of blockchain adoption trends over time.
- Research or datasets comparing **real vs. artificial adoption metrics**.
- Insights into how adoption impacts **long-term viability for a stable token**.
