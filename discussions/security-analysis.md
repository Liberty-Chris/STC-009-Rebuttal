# Security Analysis of Selected Blockchains

## **Overview**
This discussion focuses on the security risks associated with the blockchains analyzed in the STC-009 Blockchain Analysis Report. The goal is to assess vulnerabilities, past exploits, and architectural security differences to ensure the Wyoming Stable Token is deployed on a secure and resilient platform.

## **Key Questions**
- What major **security incidents** (hacks, exploits, or vulnerabilities) have affected the blockchains under consideration?
- How does **Ethereum’s EVM-based smart contract model** compare to **Cardano’s eUTXO model** in terms of security?
- Have **cross-chain bridges** introduced additional security risks, and how should they be evaluated?
- Are **formal verification and security audits** sufficient to mitigate risks?
- How do blockchains handle **governance vulnerabilities and emergency upgrades**?

## **Notable Security Incidents**
Please contribute details on past exploits, categorized by blockchain:

### **Ethereum**
- [ ] Notable smart contract exploits (e.g., The DAO hack, Parity wallet freeze, etc.)
- [ ] Issues with rollups, Layer 2 solutions, or MEV attacks

### **Solana**
- [ ] Security incidents related to validator centralization and network halts
- [ ] Any smart contract vulnerabilities or issues with the Solana runtime

### **Avalanche, Sui, and Stellar**
- [ ] Known vulnerabilities or attack vectors
- [ ] Security concerns with consensus mechanisms

### **Cardano**
- [ ] Analysis of security advantages of the eUTXO model
- [ ] Review of known vulnerabilities (if any)

## **Community Input**
Please share:
- Links to security reports, whitepapers, or audits related to these blockchains.
- Evidence of blockchain resilience against attacks (e.g., fork recovery, exploit prevention mechanisms).
- Comparisons between on-chain security frameworks.
