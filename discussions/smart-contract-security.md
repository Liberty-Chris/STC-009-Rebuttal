# Smart Contract Security and Attack Vectors

## **Overview**
This discussion focuses on the security risks and attack vectors associated with smart contracts across different blockchain ecosystems. The goal is to assess vulnerabilities, past exploits, and best practices to ensure the Wyoming Stable Token is deployed on a secure and resilient platform.

## **Key Questions**
- What are the **most common vulnerabilities** in smart contracts (e.g., reentrancy, integer overflow, logic bugs)?
- How do **Ethereum’s EVM-based smart contracts** compare to **Cardano’s eUTXO model** in terms of security?
- Have any major **DeFi or stablecoin exploits** exposed flaws in smart contract security?
- How effective are **formal verification and smart contract audits** in preventing vulnerabilities?
- What role do **oracle dependencies and price manipulation attacks** play in security risks?

## **Notable Smart Contract Exploits**
Please contribute details on past exploits, categorized by blockchain:

### **Ethereum**
- [ ] **The DAO Hack (2016)** – Reentrancy vulnerability
- [ ] **Parity Wallet Freeze (2017)** – Access control issues
- [ ] **Ronin Bridge Hack (2022)** – Cross-chain security flaws

### **Solana**
- [ ] Smart contract security vulnerabilities due to **monolithic architecture**
- [ ] Impact of **bot-driven congestion on contract execution**

### **Avalanche, Sui, and Stellar**
- [ ] Security considerations in non-EVM smart contract environments
- [ ] Any historical exploits and lessons learned

### **Cardano**
- [ ] Security benefits of the **eUTXO model**
- [ ] How Plutus smart contracts **reduce reentrancy risks**

## **Best Practices for Secure Smart Contracts**
- [ ] **Formal verification** to mathematically prove contract correctness
- [ ] **Multi-signature and governance models** to prevent unauthorized upgrades
- [ ] **Bug bounty programs** to incentivize ethical hacking
- [ ] **Use of security-focused programming languages** like Rust or Haskell

## **Community Input**
Please share:
- Research papers or case studies on smart contract security.
- Lessons from past exploits and how they could have been prevented.
- Tools and frameworks for **automated vulnerability detection**.
