# Network Performance and Reliability

## **Overview**
This discussion focuses on the network performance, uptime, and reliability of various blockchains analyzed in the STC-009 Blockchain Analysis Report. The goal is to assess which blockchains offer the most stable and efficient infrastructure for the Wyoming Stable Token.

## **Key Questions**
- What is the **historical uptime** of each blockchain, and how frequently have they experienced outages?
- How do **block finality times** compare across different networks?
- Have any blockchains suffered from **network congestion issues** that could impact usability?
- What role does **validator decentralization** play in maintaining network stability?
- How do **hardware and bandwidth requirements** affect network performance?

## **Blockchain Performance Comparisons**
Please contribute insights into the network performance of different blockchains:

### **Ethereum**
- [ ] Impact of **high gas fees and network congestion**
- [ ] Transition from **Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** and its effect on finality

### **Solana**
- [ ] History of **network outages and performance bottlenecks**
- [ ] Validator centralization and its impact on reliability

### **Cardano**
- [ ] Benefits of the **eUTXO model for scalability**
- [ ] **100% uptime history** as a key differentiator

### **Avalanche, Sui, and Stellar**
- [ ] Performance metrics for **transaction throughput** and finality
- [ ] Network resilience against **high transaction loads**

## **Performance Metrics to Consider**
- [ ] **Transactions per second (TPS)** and real-world scalability tests
- [ ] **Time to finality** and network settlement speeds
- [ ] **Historical network downtime** and causes of failures
- [ ] **Load balancing and congestion handling mechanisms**

## **Community Input**
Please share:
- Historical data on blockchain network uptime and downtime.
- Research or benchmarking reports comparing blockchain transaction speeds.
- Insights into the impact of **network architecture on performance**.
